# AI-Powered Nutrition Analyzer for Fitness Enthusiasts

## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Nutrition Analyzer** is a machine learning-based web application designed to analyze fruit images and provide nutritional information. It helps fitness enthusiasts track their diet by identifying fruits and displaying details such as **calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fiber content**.

## 👨‍💻 Team & Leadership
This project was developed as part of an **IBM-sponsored initiative**, and I **led the team** in designing, developing, and deploying the solution. The project was completed under the **Sri Muthukumaran Institute of Technology, affiliated with Anna University**.

## 🚀 Features
- **CNN-based fruit classification model** trained on a large dataset.
- **Image recognition and nutritional analysis** using AI.
- **IBM Cloud integration** for data processing and hosting.
- **User-friendly web interface** built with Flask.
- **Automated calorie estimation** based on fruit type.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks & Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, Flask
- **Cloud Services:** IBM Cloud, Watson Machine Learning
