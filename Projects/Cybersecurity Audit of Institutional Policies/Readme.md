# Cybersecurity Audit of Institutional Policies

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involved a **comprehensive cybersecurity audit** of the Illinois Institute of Technology's **Incident Response Plan, Mobile Device Policy, and System & Data Integrity Plan** to ensure compliance with **NIST Special Publication 800-171A Rev. 3**. The audit identified security gaps and provided actionable recommendations to improve risk management, policy enforcement, and compliance.

## 👨‍💻 Role & Responsibilities
As the **team leader**, I conducted the audit, analyzed institutional cybersecurity policies, performed a **detailed gap analysis**, and provided security recommendations to align policies with **NIST SP 800-171A standards**.

## 🛠 Audit Scope
- **Incident Response Plan** – Evaluated update frequency, response procedures, and recovery objectives.
- **Incident Response Standard** – Assessed corrective action timeframes and false positive management.
- **Incident Response Policy** – Reviewed reporting protocols and enforcement mechanisms.
- **Mobile Device Policy** – Examined configuration standards, monitoring, and software update procedures.
- **System & Data Integrity Plan** – Evaluated flaw remediation, situational awareness, and security monitoring.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Incident Response Plan** lacked frequent updates, law enforcement coordination, and clear recovery objectives.
- **Incident Response Policy** did not clearly define reportable incidents and response capabilities.
- **Mobile Device Policy** needed improved update mechanisms, sanitization procedures, and security monitoring.
- **System & Data Integrity Plan** lacked benchmarks for flaw remediation and failed to integrate situational awareness.

## 🔐 Recommendations & Mitigation Strategies
- **Enhance testing protocols** with diverse real-world scenarios.
- **Define clear corrective action timeframes** and improve response coordination.
- **Strengthen access controls** by implementing multi-factor authentication.
- **Optimize network traffic analysis** and integrate real-time monitoring.
- **Align cybersecurity policies** with updated **NIST SP 800-171A guidelines**.

## 📊 Impact
- Improved institutional compliance with **NIST cybersecurity standards**.
- Strengthened risk management and policy enforcement.
- Provided detailed audit reports with actionable security recommendations.
