# Network Infrastructure Design for Multi-Location Business

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involved designing a **secure and scalable network infrastructure** for **Chicago Hospitality Management Group, Inc. (CHMG)**, which operates across six locations. The goal was to implement a **VPN-based WAN**, ensure redundancy, and optimize security for efficient inter-site communication.

## 👨‍💻 Role & Responsibilities
As the **IT Manager**, I designed the infrastructure, selected network hardware, implemented security policies, and performed a **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis** to ensure cost efficiency.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **VPN-based WAN** for secure communication across all business locations.
- **Redundant network design** with dual ISP connections and BGP routing.
- **Segmentation using VLANs** to enhance security and performance.
- **Firewall and intrusion detection/prevention** for network security.
- **Active Directory integration** for centralized authentication and access control.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Equipment
- **Networking Hardware:** Ubiquiti EdgeRouter 4, UniFi Switches, PoE Adapters
- **Security & Access Control:** VLANs, IPsec VPN, Firewalls, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Cloud & Remote Access:** Secure VPN for remote employees
- **Network Monitoring Tools:** SNMP, Syslog, Automated Alerts

## 🔍 Network Architecture
- **Main Hub:** Central data center with VPN concentrator.
- **Branch Offices:** Connected via **site-to-site VPN tunnels**.
- **Leased Locations:** Secured using encrypted VPN connections.
- **Wi-Fi & Ethernet:** Enterprise-grade Wi-Fi and wired network for tenants and employees.

## 🔐 Security Measures
- **Firewall Protection:** Implemented on-premises firewalls to monitor traffic.
- **Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS):** Detects and blocks suspicious activities.
- **Redundancy & Failover:** Dual ISP connections ensure **zero downtime**.
- **Network Access Control (NAC):** Restricts unauthorized devices.

## 📊 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis
- **Networking Equipment:** $50,000 - $70,000
- **Software Licensing:** $10,000 - $15,000
- **Maintenance & Support:** $8,000 - $12,000 annually
- **Telecom Service Costs:** $6,000 - $10,000 per year
- **Implementation Costs:** $20,000 (setup and labor)
- **Estimated 3-Year TCO:** **$151,200**
