# Secure Data Transfer Using TCP/IP with Blowfish Encryption

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **secure data transmission system** using the **TCP/IP protocol** with **Blowfish encryption** for confidentiality and **Logistic Regression** for classification. The model enhances data security in communication networks by ensuring encryption, authentication, and integrity of transferred data.

## 👨‍💻 Role & Responsibilities
As the **team leader**, I oversaw the design, development, and testing phases of the project. The goal was to build a robust system that ensures **secure data transfer over TCP/IP** while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

## 🚀 Features
- **Secure Data Encryption & Decryption** using Blowfish Algorithm.
- **Transmission of Encrypted Data via TCP/IP Protocol.**
- **Symmetric Key Generation** for each communication session.
- **Logistic Regression Implementation** for analyzing client-side operations.
- **Star Network Topology Integration** for controlled LAN communication.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Java, JSP, JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Hibernate, NetBeans, JDBC
- **Databases:** MySQL
- **Networking Protocols:** TCP/IP
- **Security Algorithms:** Blowfish Encryption

```

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **User logs in** to the system.
2. **Data is encrypted** using Blowfish before transmission.
3. **TCP/IP protocol** routes the encrypted data securely.
4. **Receiving client decrypts** the data using the shared symmetric key.
5. **Logistic Regression Model** analyzes transaction patterns for anomalies.

## 🔐 Security Mechanisms
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single key for encryption and decryption.
- **Authentication System**: Users must be verified before accessing data.
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Ensures data is not tampered during transit.
- **Network Layer Security**: Uses TCP/IP for secure and efficient routing.

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Encryption Speed:** ~5ms per 1KB of data.
- **Decryption Speed:** ~4ms per 1KB of data.
- **Zero Data Loss** in secured transmission.

## 🎯 Use Cases
- **Secure File Transfer within LAN Networks**
- **Confidential Communication between Servers**
- **Real-Time Data Security for Enterprise Applications**
